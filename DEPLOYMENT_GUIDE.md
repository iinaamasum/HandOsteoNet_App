# HandOsteoNet Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide provides instructions for deploying HandOsteoNet on Streamlit Cloud with optimized performance.

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Model Loading Optimization
- Model is cached using `@st.cache_resource` to prevent reloading
- Device detection is cached for faster initialization
- Preprocessor and data manager are cached

### 2. Session State Management
- Session state is properly initialized before use
- No caching on session state initialization to prevent conflicts
- Proper error handling for missing session state keys

### 3. File Handling
- Temporary files are cleaned up immediately after use
- Unique timestamps prevent file conflicts
- Local vs cloud deployment detection for file operations

### 4. Memory Management
- GradCAM images are deleted after display
- Large tensors are moved to appropriate devices
- No unnecessary data retention

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Repository Setup
```bash
# Ensure all files are committed
git add .
git commit -m "Optimized for deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Streamlit Cloud Deployment
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Streamlit Cloud
2. Set the main file path to `app.py`
3. Deploy the application

### 3. Environment Configuration
The app automatically detects deployment environment:
- **Local**: Full functionality including file saving
- **Cloud**: Disabled file saving for privacy and security

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Session State Errors
**Problem**: `AttributeError: st.session_state has no attribute "current_page"`
**Solution**: Session state is now properly initialized before use

#### 2. Model Loading Slow
**Problem**: Model takes too long to load
**Solution**: 
- Model is cached after first load
- Device detection is optimized
- Loading progress is shown to users

#### 3. Media File Errors
**Problem**: Missing media files in deployment
**Solution**: 
- Temporary files use unique timestamps
- Files are cleaned up immediately
- No persistent file storage in cloud

#### 4. Memory Issues
**Problem**: High memory usage
**Solution**:
- GradCAM images are deleted after use
- Tensors are moved to appropriate devices
- No unnecessary data retention

### Performance Monitoring

#### Load Time Optimization
- Model loading: ~30-60 seconds on first run
- Subsequent loads: ~1-2 seconds (cached)
- Image processing: ~5-10 seconds per image

#### Memory Usage
- Model: ~500MB
- Image processing: ~100MB per image
- Temporary files: <10MB

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- No data is stored permanently in cloud deployment
- Images are processed and immediately deleted
- No personal information is collected

### File Operations
- Local deployment: Full file operations enabled
- Cloud deployment: File operations disabled for security

## Maintenance

### Regular Updates
1. Monitor Streamlit Cloud logs for errors
2. Update dependencies as needed
3. Test functionality after updates

### Performance Monitoring
1. Check load times regularly
2. Monitor memory usage
3. Verify model accuracy
